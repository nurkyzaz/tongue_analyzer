# TongueInsight — Master Plan (v2, 2026-07-16)

**This is the single source of truth for what's left to build.** It supersedes the two founding
plans (`Tongue analysis ML.md`, `…(1).md`) and the scattered `*_PLAN` / `*_IMPROVEMENT` / `DIRECTION_REVIEW`
docs (to be archived — see §6). Deep history stays in `docs/PROGRESS.md` and `git log`.

The project is an **educational, non-diagnostic** wellness feature (計五味 / Savor): tongue photo →
detected features → a grounded TCM "constitution leaning," framed as *"traditionally associated with…"*.

**Positioning (2026-07-16):** we are building this as a **free community tool** — anyone can use it to
help make sense of their own tongue. We have (or are receiving) permission to ground it on internet
resources; the running list of usable sources + licenses is in **[INTERNET_RESOURCES.md](INTERNET_RESOURCES.md)**.
**Two goals in tension, both held:** (1) a genuinely-grounded, insightful reading; (2) **cheap mobile
deployment** — the shipped setup must stay light (thin client + cheap CPU box). Every enhancement below
is filtered through that second lens (§7).

### Progress since v2 (updated 2026-07-16)
- **WS-G cleanup — done** (§6). **WS-A knowledge graph — substantially done:** seed + WHO-spine + macro +
  micro layers all built and parity-verified (`stage2_interpretation/kg/`, **605 nodes / 1245 edges /
  282 cited snippets**). Micro layer extracted with **qwen2.5:14b** (free, on casper) from **three
  licensed books** — Gerlach (ch.2–7, decimal), Oriental Tongue Diagnosis + Maciocia (title-heading
  parser, all sections) — **282 cited feature→pattern edges, 0 junk**, 98 candidates held (60 signs our
  detector can't observe, e.g. sublingual veins). **WHO-IST 2022 ontology spine** (`who_terms.py` →
  `who_spine.json`) tags 25 pattern/feature nodes with canonical code + 中文 + pīnyīn for bilingual
  output. Remaining WS-A polish: expand the alias map for Gerlach's Latin candidates; Chinese textbooks
  blocked (no source files). Next major step: **WS-C grounded matcher** over this graph.
- **WS-F output design:** a Claude Design handoff bundle (Savor 舌 tab) is in `prompt-execution-request/`;
  it maps 1:1 onto WS-B (Refine flow), WS-C (linkage cards + confidence bars), and the Sources sheet
  (citation-only / citation+snippet licensing states). Iterating on it collaboratively.
- **WS-C — built & gated (2026-07-16):** grounded matcher (`kg/matcher.py`) + shadow run (0 hallucination,
  0.50 top-1 vs rules, within-family) → **ensemble** `kg/ensemble.py` (rule prior + cited matcher evidence,
  `blended=(1-α)·rule+α·matcher`, abstention neutral, matcher-only hints capped at α). Wired into
  `interpret.py` behind `TIH_WSC_ENSEMBLE` (**default OFF** — promotion decision). **α sweep on human40
  picked α=0.2:** stability-vs-rule **0.85**, lead-cited **0.90**, matcher-added/hallucination 0.0, **WS-D
  faithfulness 0.929** — vs α=0.35 (0.75 / 0.925 / 0.868). Citations attach independent of α, so α=0.2
  keeps the grounding while recovering faithfulness to ~the rule-only baseline (0.936) → the tradeoff is
  gone. **Step 4 done:** raw `confidence_pct` on every card + shown in UI (was a word only).
- **Promoted 2026-07-16: `TIH_WSC_ENSEMBLE` is default-ON and LIVE** on the casper demo (qwen2.5:14b) —
  verified end-to-end (`/analyze` returns cited, %-scored ensemble patterns).
- **WS-B — DONE (2026-07-16):** interactive evidence refinement (`kg/refine_engine.py`). Two-pass reading:
  `select_questions` picks the items that best **disambiguate the top-2** (info gain = probe weight ×
  contestedness, covering both candidates) → replaces the fixed per-pattern list; `rescore` folds the
  user's yes/no answers in over the KG's answer→pattern edges and **re-ranks the whole set** (a strong
  'yes' on the runner-up can overtake the lead). Wired into `interpret.py` (`_followup_block`) + `/refine`
  pass-2 + the frontend. Verified live: t12 phlegm 69% vs spleen 59% → after answers, spleen → 74% (#1).
  The transparent log-odds `refine()` stays as the interim fallback. **WS-E deploy is next.**

---

## 1. Where we are (honest status)

**Stage 1 (vision) — essentially DONE and frozen.**
- Segmentation `seg_combined` (U-Net++), real-photo Dice ~0.975.
- Characteristics `multitask_v5` (5 core signs + severity) — **production**; v6/v7/v8 all failed to beat it
  on the human metric. Extra features + training-free geometry (`zoning.py`: red-tip, moisture).
- Honest accuracy: ~61% exact 3-way vs human labels, but **97% within-one-grade**; presence is strong.
- **We are not chasing Stage-1 accuracy further** — auto-labels are the ceiling; more label data is the
  only real lever, and that's on hold. Vision is good enough to ship.

**Stage 2 (interpretation) — the current focus.** Works today (rule-engine votes + combination rules +
a grounded RAG/LLM narrator over a 102-chunk self-authored corpus), but this is exactly what we're
overhauling with the newly-licensed literature (§3).

**Deployment — decided:** cheap CPU server, thin-client app. See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

### What the original plan promised that we're now DROPPING (and why)
| Dropped item | Why |
|---|---|
| SAM-based segmentation | Replaced by U-Net++ (done, better fit for real photos) |
| Full **773-phenotype** extraction | Evidence shows auto-labels cap accuracy; not worth the complexity |
| **MMIR-TCM** adaptation / MedTCM / TDEU | No code or data ever released — we built our own Stage 2 |
| Grad-CAM explainability | RAG **citations** are a better, cheaper explainability story |
| ONNX / INT8 / distillation / LoRA | Unnecessary: inference is already 0.34 s on CPU. Revisit only for a future on-device build |

---

## 2. The target architecture for Stage 2

Adapted from **TCM-DiffRAG** (`tongue_lit/TCM_Rag.pdf`), constrained to cheap-CPU serving. Key insight:
their expensive query-time step (a fine-tuned model that decomposes free-text vignettes into triples) is
**unnecessary for us — Stage-1 output is already structured triples.** We inherit the KG + retrieval
gains; per-request cost stays one LLM call.

```
Stage-1 JSON (features + confidences)          ← unchanged, code-computed
      │
      ▼   entry nodes = detected features (deterministic; no CoT decomposer needed)
MACRO-MICRO TCM KNOWLEDGE GRAPH  (built offline from the licensed books)
   macro = book chapter/section hierarchy   → explanatory context, semantic integrity
   micro = LLM-extracted triplets w/ source citation → precise feature→pattern locking
      │
      ▼   macro-micro integrated + hybrid (semantic+lexical) retrieval
GROUNDED MATCHER (LLM, cite-or-abstain, structured output)
   proposes patterns + evidence triples + citations
   rule engine runs alongside as a computed prior/referee (shadow → ensemble)
      │
      ▼   confidence = detection × distinctiveness × evidence-convergence  (computed, reproducible)
READING  →  [optional] interactive refinement pass (§ WS-B)  →  output (§5)
```

---

## 3. Workstreams (the actual work left)

### WS-A · Macro-micro knowledge graph from the licensed literature  *(foundation — do first)*
Sources now in `tongue_lit/` (we have usage rights):
- **Gerlach, *TCM Tongue Diagnosis Explained*** — modern, feature-organized, clean section hierarchy → the backbone.
- **Maciocia, *Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine*** — depth/authority.
- **WHO International Standard Terminologies on TCM (2022)** — the **controlled vocabulary** to normalize node names (bilingual).
- **Oriental Tongue Diagnosis** — supplementary (zoning/meridians).

Steps:
1. **Ontology spine** from the WHO terminology → canonical bilingual names for features & patterns.
2. **Macro layer** — parse each book's hierarchy into title nodes (Gerlach's numbering parses directly).
3. **Micro layer** — LLM-extract triplets offline (on casper): `feature→pattern`, `feature+context→pattern`,
   `pattern→symptom`, `pattern→recommendation`, `pattern↔pattern` disambiguation — **each with a source
   citation + snippet** (traceability).
4. **Seed as a SUPERSET of today's `tcm_knowledge.json`** so day-one it reproduces current rules, then grows.
5. Store: graph (nodes/edges + adjacency) + a snippet store. Build script offline; artifact shipped read-only.

**Licensing check-in:** confirm the grant covers surfacing *short cited snippets to end users* vs internal
processing only. Architecture stays safe either way (triplets + short attributed snippets).

### WS-B · Interactive evidence refinement  *(your follow-up-questions idea — the "personalization" layer)*
Replaces the paper's training-time personalized KG with an inference-time, data-free equivalent.
1. **Two-pass reading.** Pass 1: tongue features → candidate patterns + the questions that would most
   *disambiguate* them. Pass 2: user's yes/no (or slider) answers enter as **symptom evidence** and
   re-run retrieval+reasoning over the *same* KG (`symptom→pattern` edges).
2. **Question selection by information gain** — pick the item that best separates the top-2 candidates,
   not a fixed per-pattern list. Draw from validated CCMQ items where possible.
3. Keep the transparent log-odds `refine()` as the fallback/interim.
4. *(optional, later)* A lightweight **data-derived "stylized" KG**: mine our practitioner-labeled sets
   (TCM-Tongue) for feature↔pattern co-occurrence → grounding cards from *our own data*. Closest analog
   to the paper's approach that our data actually supports.

### WS-C · Grounded matcher + honest confidence
1. LLM matcher, **cite-or-abstain**, temperature 0, structured JSON out (patterns + evidence + citations).
2. **Shadow mode first:** run alongside the rule engine on the gallery; log disagreements; score both.
3. Promote to **full-LLM or ensemble** based on the numbers (don't decide in advance).
4. **Add raw confidence % back** into the output (currently overwritten by a word) — small, independent task.

### WS-D · Evaluation & safety  *(the gate — nothing promotes without this)*
1. Adopt **RAGAS** (faithfulness, context precision/recall) like the paper — this *is* the hallucination gate.
2. Expand `eval_mapping.py` well past 12 combos; keep TCMEval-SDT (rules baseline 69.7%) and `eval_rag.py`.
3. **Hallucination-rate check before defaulting the LLM ON** in production.
4. (Later, pre-commercial) expert TCM blind review of narrative quality.

### WS-E · Deployment  *(per `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`)*
1. Containerize FastAPI on the cheap CPU box (CPU torch, bake the 3 checkpoints, pin deps).
2. Narrative served **off-box** (casper or hosted) once WS-C/WS-D clear; template is the always-on fallback.
3. **Licensing blocker for paid ship:** retrain seg without SM-Tongue (CC-BY-NC) or license it.

### WS-F · Output / UX design  *(user-led — scaffold in §5)*

### WS-G · Repo cleanup  *(§6)*

## 4. Sequence & dependencies

```
WS-A (KG build)  ──►  WS-C (matcher, shadow)  ──►  WS-D (eval gate)  ──►  WS-E (deploy narrator on)
      │                     ▲
      └──►  WS-B (refinement, uses symptom edges from the KG)
WS-F (output design) runs in parallel (user).   WS-G (cleanup) is independent, do anytime.
Quick win, anytime: raw confidence % (part of WS-C.4).
```

---

## 5. Next design phase — how the output is presented (scaffold for WS-F)

Everything the pipeline **can** surface (you decide what's in / out / how grouped):

**Currently shown:** headline · findings text · ranked findings (five-flavour tags) · graded severity bars ·
constitution-leaning chip · 宜/忌 recommendation · "you might also notice" symptoms · distinctiveness hooks ·
confidence note · per-sign detail · top-3 patterns · follow-up questions.

**Computed but NOT shown (candidates):** raw per-class confidence % · full pattern distribution (not just
top-3) · which combination rules fired ("why we read it this way") · the **RAG citations/snippets** for
this reading · suppressed low-distinctiveness features · shareable "tongue-type" card (built, currently
unwired) · history/trend across visits (needs app-side storage).

**Design principles to hold (from the brand + our honesty discipline):**
- Educational, **non-diagnostic** — "傳統上多與…有關", never a disease conclusion.
- **Honest uncertainty** — show the confidence note; flag tentative reads; never over-claim faint signs.
- **Progressive disclosure** — one-line headline → findings → detail on tap. Don't dump everything.
- Almanac / five-flavour brand; pressure-free Cantonese voice; result optionally shareable.

**Open questions for you:** how much clinical detail to expose vs hide? Show citations to users (trust) or
keep them internal? Surface the follow-up flow inline or as an optional "refine" step? Include history/trend
in v1 or defer? Reinstate the tongue-type share card?

## 6. Repo cleanup (DONE 2026-07-16)

Executed. `docs/` went from 26 → 11 living files; `evaluation/` from 23 → 12 living scripts.
All moves were `git mv` (history preserved); nothing was destroyed.

**Removed (OS junk):** `__MACOSX/`.
**Archived → `docs/archive/`** (historical, superseded by this plan): the two `Tongue analysis ML*.md`,
`DIRECTION_REVIEW`, `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN`, `KB_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN`, `LABEL_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN`, `OUTPUT_REDESIGN_PLAN`,
`ACCURACY_INVESTIGATION`, `LABEL_QUALITY_DIAGNOSIS`, `CONSTITUTION_BENCHMARK`, `COATING_SPLIT`,
`COLOR_CALIBRATION`, `FEATURE_FEEDBACK_2026-07-13`, `PHASE4_TCM_TONGUE`, `BENCHMARK_DESIGN`, `TCM_RESEARCH`,
`RAG_LLM_INTERPRETATION`.
**Living docs (kept):** `PLAN.md` (this), `PROGRESS.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`,
`LABELING_GUIDE.md`, `LABEL_STORE.md`, `BENCHMARK.md`, `FEATURE_MAPPING_REFERENCE.md`,
`FEATURE_PATTERN_MAPPING.md`, `RESOURCES.md`.
**Archived one-off eval scripts → `evaluation/archive/`:** `diagnose_confusion`, `diagnose_label_agreement`,
`calibrate_logit_adjust`, `eval_memory_sam`, `find_professional_labels`, `benchmark_multimodal`,
`eval_human_labels`, `eval_fair`, `eval_vs_expert`, `eval_color_calib`, `eval_zoning`.
**Living harnesses (kept):** `eval_model`, `eval_mapping`, `eval_rag`, `eval_seg`, `eval_stage1`,
`eval_coat_axes`, `eval_extra_features`, `benchmark`, `benchmark_syndrome`, `build_gallery`,
`build_label_tool`, `select_eval_set`.

**Left in place (your call):** `design.zip` (15 KB, harmless — the unzipped `design/` is untracked too).
**Still TODO:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` needs a refresh (still describes the dropped SAM/MMIR-TCM plan).

## 7. Evaluated enhancement backlog (2026-07-16)

The recommended A–E enhancement set, each scored through the **deployment-light lens** (goal 2: cheap
mobile ship). **Verdict key:** ✅ accept (in scope) · ⏸ defer (value unclear / too heavy for cheap ship) ·
🔬 accept-as-eval-gated (adopt only if it beats v5/rules on the honest metric). Most of the KB work is
**offline/build-time** → it compiles into static data and adds **zero runtime weight**, so it's cheap to
accept. Runtime additions (extra LLM calls, big models, re-rankers) are where we hold the line.

### 🔴 A · Knowledge base & mapping — **highest leverage, all offline → ACCEPT**
| Item | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Finish Gerlach ch.5–6; parse Maciocia, Oriental Tongue Diagnosis | ✅ | offline; Maciocia adds alternative interpretations (pale→Blood-def) |
| WHO IST 2022 as **ontology spine** (canonical bilingual node names) | ✅ | enables bilingual output + clean merging; the normalization backbone |
| Chinese textbooks (朱文锋, 李灿东) | ✅ pending-rights | greasy-coat subtypes etc. — confirm usage rights first |
| Recalibrate weights = empirical distinctiveness (∝ 1/corpus-freq) | ✅ | once the KG has hundreds of cited triplets; rare findings count more |
| Expand combination rules (red_tip+white→Heart-Lung heat; purple+dry→Heat-stasis vs purple+moist→Cold-stasis) | ✅ | tiny static rules, high precision |
| **Negation rules** (thick **but peeled** → Stomach-Yin damage, not Damp-heat) | ✅ | fixes real false-positives |
| **Symptom→pattern edges** section (fatigue→Qi-def, thirst→Yin-def) | ✅ | **required for WS-B**; already partly seeded as `evidence_for` |

**Status of "Update `tcm_knowledge.json` itself" (2026-07-16) — NOT started at the file level.**
The §7-A **weight recalibration is done but in the graph-RAG scoring layer** (`kg/retrieval.py`:
sublinear corroboration + IDF distinctiveness) — deliberately *not* in `tcm_knowledge.json`, whose seed
weights stay hand-tuned and parity-locked so the production rule engine is unchanged. The file-level
edits are still **pending**: the current 10 combination rules do **not** yet include the new
Heart-Lung-heat (`red_tip+white`), pale+thin→Blood-def override, or the purple **dry vs moist**
heat-/cold-stasis split; there are **no negation rules** (thick-but-peeled → Stomach-Yin damage); and
there is **no dedicated user-symptom→pattern section** (symptoms live per-pattern as
`associated_symptoms`, which the KG already turns into `evidence_for` edges — the WS-B lever exists, but
a first-class symptom section does not). These are the next WS-A file edits.

### 🟠 B · Stage-1 feature extraction — **accept only the light/geometry parts**
| Item | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Moisture** wet↔dry classifier | ✅ (geometry, no retrain) | extend `zoning.py` specular-gloss; unlocks wet→phlegm/yang-def, dry→yin-def/heat (3–4 ambiguous combos) |
| **Location-aware cracks/dots** (route tip/centre/sides/root → organs) | ✅ (post-process) | crack_centre→spleen, crack_sides→liver, dots_tip→heart-heat = 4 new KB edges; cheap routing on existing detections |
| Full Stage-1 **retrain** / drop SM-Tongue for a moisture head | ⏸ | Stage-1 is **frozen** (label ceiling; v5 beat v6/v7/v8). Adds weight+time for little honest gain. Revisit only with real phone data. |

### 🟡 C · RAG & LLM pipeline — **graph-RAG + structured output in; extra calls & big models out**
| Item | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Graph RAG** — retrieve 2-hop subgraph around detected feature nodes | ✅ | the whole reason we built the KG; gives the LLM relationships, not isolated facts. No runtime weight. |
| **Structured output / JSON-mode** (cite-or-abstain schema via `response_format`) | ✅ | removes parse errors, zero cost — do with WS-C |
| Cross-encoder re-ranker (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6) | 🔬 | ~22M params, CPU-ok; adopt only if it lifts hit@1 measurably (WS-D). Borderline weight. |
| HyDE (hypothetical-answer retrieval) | ⏸ | extra LLM call/request — conflicts with the one-call cheap-serve budget. Keep as optional edge-case path. |
| Swap to qwen32b / deepseek-r1:14b for **serving** | ⏸ | too heavy for cheap deploy. Use big models **offline for extraction only**; serve small model / template. |
| Self-consistency (3× sample + majority vote) | ⏸ | 3× cost. Note as opt-in for flagged high-ambiguity cases only. |
| WS-B **information-gain question selection** | ✅ | already core plan; KG has the `evidence_for`/`probes` edges |

### 🟢 D · Evaluation & safety — **the gate, all offline → ACCEPT**
| Item | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **RAGAS** (faithfulness, context precision/recall) as hallucination gate | ✅ | faithfulness < 0.85 → block LLM, fall back to template |
| Expand `eval_mapping.py` 12 → 50+ combos (incl. Maciocia cases) | ✅ | cover new-KG edge cases |
| Blind TCM-expert review (pre-commercial) | ✅ | template vs RAG-LLM vs ground truth; factual-error rate |

### 🔵 E · Deployment & UX — **accept; SSE streaming optional**
| Item | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Surface **citations** (Sources sheet) — book + loc, zh chars + translation | ✅ | design already has the sheet (§5); wire `sources`/`reasoning` cites |
| Licensing for snippets (citation-only vs citation+snippet states) | ✅ | architecture supports both; gate on the grant |
| Containerize with CPU (bake checkpoints) | ✅ | per DEPLOYMENT.md |
| `/v2/analyze` **SSE streaming** ("generating…") | ⏸ nice-to-have | non-blocking UX; not required for v1 |
| **Feedback loop** — optional 👍/👎 + free-text ("was this helpful?") | ✅ | cheap; the **community signal** to recalibrate KB weights (A) over time |

**Net effect on the shipped bundle:** all ✅ items are either offline (compile to static KG/JSON) or
zero-added-weight runtime logic (graph lookups, JSON-mode, one lightweight classifier head in geometry).
The deferred (⏸) items are exactly the ones that would inflate per-request cost or model size. So the
backlog is fully compatible with goal 2 (cheap mobile ship).

### Updated sequence
```
WS-A (KB: finish books + WHO spine + weights/negation/symptom edges)  ← accept-all, offline
   └─► WS-C (graph-RAG + JSON-mode matcher, shadow)  ─► WS-D (RAGAS + 50-combo gate)  ─► WS-E (deploy)
   └─► WS-B (symptom edges + info-gain questions)
WS-F (phone demo/UX — the design bundle, in progress) runs in parallel.
Stage-1 geometry adds (moisture, crack/dot location) slot into WS-A as new edges — light, no retrain.
```
